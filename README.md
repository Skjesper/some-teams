Hey and welcome to my first project!

In this project, I created a foreach loop from an array containing information about a women's football league. I used HTML and CSS to style the output. And tried to make it as responsive as possible.
Throughout the development process, I made frequent commits and regularly pushed the changes to GitHub to maintain a clear version history and workflow.
